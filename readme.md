# Students Table Database Tasks

This document outlines the SQL commands executed in PostgreSQL (psql) for table alteration tasks on the `students` table and the creation of a new `courses` table. It includes explanations for each task and Mermaid syntax to visualize the updated `students` table structure.

## Table Structure Overview

The students table initially has the following structure:

| Column Name  | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Auto-incremented primary key           |
| `roll`       | Unique roll number for each student    |
| `name`       | Name of the student                    |
| `age`        | Age of the student                     |
| `department` | Studentâ€™s department (e.g., CSE, EEE)  |
| `score`      | Score achieved by the student          |
| `status`     | Academic status (e.g., passed, failed) |
| `last_login` | Last login date                        |

# SQL Commands and Explanations

Below are the SQL commands for the tasks, each followed by an explanation of its purpose.

### 0. Create the Database, Table, and Insert Sample Data

#### Create a new database

```psql
CREATE DATABASE studentdb;
```

- Explanation: This command creates a new PostgreSQL database named `studentdb`.

#### Connect to the new database

```psql
\c studentdb
```

- Explanation: Switches your session to the `studentdb` database.

#### Create the students table

```psql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    roll VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR,
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR,
    score FLOAT,
    status VARCHAR,
    last_login DATE
);
```

- Explanation: This command creates the initial `students` table with the specified columns.

#### Insert sample data into students table

```psql
INSERT INTO students (roll, name, age, department, score, status, last_login) VALUES
('2023001', 'Alice', 20, 'CSE', 85.5, 'passed', '2024-06-01'),
('2023002', 'Bob', 21, 'EEE', 78.0, 'passed', '2024-06-02'),
('2023003', 'Charlie', 22, 'CSE', 65.0, 'failed', '2024-06-03');
```

- Explanation: Inserts three sample student records into the `students` table for testing and demonstration.

#### Mermaid Table Visualization (After Insert)

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
    int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
    varchar roll "2023001, 2023002, 2023003"
    varchar name "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
    int age "20, 21, 22"
    varchar department "CSE, EEE"
    float score "85.5, 78.0, 65.0"
    varchar status "passed, failed"
    date last_login "2024-06-01, 2024-06-02, 2024-06-03"
}
```

#### Data Table Visualization (After Insert)

| id  | roll    | name    | age | department | score | status | last_login |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | 2023001 | Alice   | 20  | CSE        | 85.5  | passed | 2024-06-01 |
| 2   | 2023002 | Bob     | 21  | EEE        | 78.0  | passed | 2024-06-02 |
| 3   | 2023003 | Charlie | 22  | CSE        | 65.0  | failed | 2024-06-03 |

### 1. Add a column email (VARCHAR) to the students table

```psql
ALTER TABLE students
ADD email VARCHAR;
```

- Explanation: This command adds a new email column of type `VARCHAR` to the students table. The column is nullable, and existing rows will have `NULL` values in this column.

#### Mermaid Table Visualization (After Adding `email` Column)

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
    int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
    varchar roll "2023001, 2023002, 2023003"
    varchar name "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
    int age "20, 21, 22"
    varchar department "CSE, EEE"
    float score "85.5, 78.0, 65.0"
    varchar status "passed, failed"
    varchar email "NULL"
    date last_login "2024-06-01, 2024-06-02, 2024-06-03"
}
```

#### Data Table Visualization (After Adding `email` Column)

| id  | roll    | name    | age | department | score | status | email | last_login |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ---------- |
| 1   | 2023001 | Alice   | 20  | CSE        | 85.5  | passed | NULL  | 2024-06-01 |
| 2   | 2023002 | Bob     | 21  | EEE        | 78.0  | passed | NULL  | 2024-06-02 |
| 3   | 2023003 | Charlie | 22  | CSE        | 65.0  | failed | NULL  | 2024-06-03 |

### ALTER TABLE students

```psql
RENAME COLUMN email TO student_email;
```

Explanation: This command renames the email column to `student_email` for clarity or consistency. The data in the column remains unchanged.

#### Mermaid Table Visualization (After Renaming `email` to `student_email`)

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
    int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
    varchar roll "Unique roll number"
    varchar name "Student name"
    int age "Student age"
    varchar department "e.g., CSE, EEE"
    float score "Student score"
    varchar status "e.g., passed, failed"
    varchar student_email "Student email"
    date last_login "Last login date"
}
```

#### Data Table Visualization (After Renaming `email` to `student_email`)

| id  | roll    | name    | age | department | score | status | student_email | last_login |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 2023001 | Alice   | 20  | CSE        | 85.5  | passed | NULL          | 2024-06-01 |
| 2   | 2023002 | Bob     | 21  | EEE        | 78.0  | passed | NULL          | 2024-06-02 |
| 3   | 2023003 | Charlie | 22  | CSE        | 65.0  | failed | NULL          | 2024-06-03 |

### ALTER TABLE students

```psql
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_student_email UNIQUE (student_email);
```

Explanation: This command adds a `UNIQUE` constraint named `unique_student_email` to the `student_email` column, ensuring no duplicate email addresses exist. If duplicates are present, the command will fail until resolved.

#### Mermaid Table Visualization (After Adding UNIQUE Constraint to `student_email`)

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
    int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
    varchar roll "Unique roll number"
    varchar name "Student name"
    int age "Student age"
    varchar department "e.g., CSE, EEE"
    float score "Student score"
    varchar status "e.g., passed, failed"
    varchar student_email "Unique student email"
    date last_login "Last login date"
}
```

#### Data Table Visualization (After Adding UNIQUE Constraint to `student_email`)

| id  | roll    | name    | age | department | score | status | student_email | last_login |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 2023001 | Alice   | 20  | CSE        | 85.5  | passed | NULL          | 2024-06-01 |
| 2   | 2023002 | Bob     | 21  | EEE        | 78.0  | passed | NULL          | 2024-06-02 |
| 3   | 2023003 | Charlie | 22  | CSE        | 65.0  | failed | NULL          | 2024-06-03 |

#### Data Table Visualization (After Creating `courses` Table)

| course_id | course_name | department |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
|           |             |            |

_No data has been inserted yet. The table is ready to accept new course records._

#### Data Table Visualization (After Dropping `last_login` Column)

| id  | roll    | name    | age | department | score | status | student_email |
| --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1   | 2023001 | Alice   | 20  | CSE        | 85.5  | passed | NULL          |
| 2   | 2023002 | Bob     | 21  | EEE        | 78.0  | passed | NULL          |
| 3   | 2023003 | Charlie | 22  | CSE        | 65.0  | failed | NULL          |

### Mermaid Syntax for students Table

The following Mermaid syntax visualizes the students table structure after all alterations (adding `student_email` and dropping `last_login`):

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
varchar roll "Unique roll number"
varchar name "Student name"
int age "Student age"
varchar department "e.g., CSE, EEE"
float score "Student score"
varchar status "e.g., passed, failed"
varchar student_email "Unique student email"
}
```

## Using the Commands in psql

### To execute these commands in PostgreSQL:

Connect to your database:

```psql
psql -U <username> -d <database_name>
```

- Run the SQL commands:Copy and paste each SQL command into the psql terminal in the order provided. Ensure the students table exists before running alteration commands.

- Verify the table structure:Check the updated students table structure with:
  `\d students`

### Notes

- The commands assume the students table exists in the database.
- The courses table is created as a new table with a primary key.
- The Mermaid diagram reflects the students table structure after all changes.
- Ensure you have schema modification permissions in psql.
- If adding the UNIQUE constraint fails due to duplicate student*email values, identify duplicates with:SELECT student_email, COUNT(*)
- Resolve duplicates before reapplying the constraint.

## Filtering & Logical Operations

### 1. Find all students who have a score greater than 80 and not null

```psql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE score > 80 AND score IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Exclude students from a specific department using NOT

```psql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE department NOT IN ('EEE');
```

_Replace `'EEE'` with the department you want to exclude._

### 3. Fetch students whose names start with 'A' using LIKE and ILIKE

```psql
-- Case-sensitive
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Case-insensitive
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name ILIKE 'A%';
```

### 4. Select all students whose age is between 18 and 25

```psql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25;
```

### 5. Retrieve rows using IN for a specific set of roll numbers

```psql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE roll IN ('2023001', '2023003');
```

_Replace the roll numbers as needed._

---

## Aggregate Functions

### 1. Count how many students exist in the students table

```psql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
```

### 2. Find the average score of students in a specific department

```psql
SELECT AVG(score) FROM students
WHERE department = 'CSE';
```

_Replace `'CSE'` with your department._

### 3. Get the maximum and minimum age of all students

```psql
SELECT MAX(age) AS max_age, MIN(age) AS min_age FROM students;
```

---

## Update & Delete Operations

### 1. Update the status of students who scored less than 50 to 'failed'

```psql
UPDATE students
SET status = 'failed'
WHERE score < 50;
```

### 2. Delete students who have not logged in since last year

```psql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE last_login < (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year');
```

### 3. Use LIMIT and OFFSET to fetch the second page of results (5 per page)

```psql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```
