# Students Table Database Tasks

This document outlines the SQL commands executed in PostgreSQL (psql) for table alteration tasks on the `students` table and the creation of a new `courses` table. It includes explanations for each task and Mermaid syntax to visualize the updated `students` table structure.

## Table Structure Overview

The students table initially has the following structure:

| Column Name  | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Auto-incremented primary key           |
| `roll`       | Unique roll number for each student    |
| `name`       | Name of the student                    |
| `age`        | Age of the student                     |
| `department` | Studentâ€™s department (e.g., CSE, EEE)  |
| `score`      | Score achieved by the student          |
| `status`     | Academic status (e.g., passed, failed) |
| `last_login` | Last login date                        |

# SQL Commands and Explanations

Below are the SQL commands for the tasks, each followed by an explanation of its purpose.

### 0. Create the Database, Table, and Insert Sample Data

#### Create a new database

```psql
CREATE DATABASE studentdb;
```

- Explanation: This command creates a new PostgreSQL database named `studentdb`.

#### Connect to the new database

```psql
\c studentdb
```

- Explanation: Switches your session to the `studentdb` database.

#### Create the students table

```psql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    roll VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR,
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR,
    score FLOAT,
    status VARCHAR,
    last_login DATE
);
```

- Explanation: This command creates the initial `students` table with the specified columns.

#### Insert sample data into students table

```psql
INSERT INTO students (roll, name, age, department, score, status, last_login) VALUES
('2023001', 'Alice', 20, 'CSE', 85.5, 'passed', '2024-06-01'),
('2023002', 'Bob', 21, 'EEE', 78.0, 'passed', '2024-06-02'),
('2023003', 'Charlie', 22, 'CSE', 65.0, 'failed', '2024-06-03');
```

- Explanation: Inserts three sample student records into the `students` table for testing and demonstration.

### 1. Add a column email (VARCHAR) to the students table

```psql
ALTER TABLE students
ADD email VARCHAR;
```

- Explanation: This command adds a new email column of type `VARCHAR` to the students table. The column is nullable, and existing rows will have `NULL` values in this column. 2. Rename the column `email` to `student_email`

### ALTER TABLE students

```psql
RENAME COLUMN email TO student_email;
```

Explanation: This command renames the email column to `student_email` for clarity or consistency. The data in the column remains unchanged. 3. Add a `UNIQUE` constraint to `student_email`

### ALTER TABLE students

```psql
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_student_email UNIQUE (student_email);
```

Explanation: This command adds a `UNIQUE` constraint named unique_student_email to the `student_email` column, ensuring no duplicate email addresses exist. If duplicates are present, the command will fail until resolved. 4. Create a new table courses with a `PRIMARY KEY`

```psql
CREATE TABLE courses (
course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
course_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
department VARCHAR
);
```

- Explanation: This command creates a new courses table with three columns: `course_id` (an auto-incrementing primary key), `course_name` (a required string), and department (an optional string). The `SERIAL` type ensures unique, sequential IDs. 5. Drop the `last_login` column from the students table.

### ALTER TABLE students

```psql
DROP COLUMN last_login;
```

- Explanation: This command permanently removes the `last_login` column from the students table, deleting all associated data. Ensure the column is no longer needed before executing.

### Mermaid Syntax for students Table

The following Mermaid syntax visualizes the students table structure after all alterations (adding `student_email` and dropping `last_login`):

```mermaid
erDiagram
STUDENTS {
int id PK "Auto-incremented primary key"
varchar roll "Unique roll number"
varchar name "Student name"
int age "Student age"
varchar department "e.g., CSE, EEE"
float score "Student score"
varchar status "e.g., passed, failed"
varchar student_email "Unique student email"
}
```

## Using the Commands in psql

### To execute these commands in PostgreSQL:

Connect to your database:

```psql
psql -U <username> -d <database_name>
```

- Run the SQL commands:Copy and paste each SQL command into the psql terminal in the order provided. Ensure the students table exists before running alteration commands.

- Verify the table structure:Check the updated students table structure with:
  `\d students`

### Notes

- The commands assume the students table exists in the database.
- The courses table is created as a new table with a primary key.
- The Mermaid diagram reflects the students table structure after all changes.
- Ensure you have schema modification permissions in psql.
- If adding the UNIQUE constraint fails due to duplicate student*email values, identify duplicates with:SELECT student_email, COUNT(*)

```psql
FROM students
GROUP BY student*email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

- Resolve duplicates before reapplying the constraint.
